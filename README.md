# Pexeso Game 🃏🥷

## About the Game

Pexeso is a classic memory game where the main goal is to find pairs of identical cards. To make the gameplay more engaging and less repetitive, this version is designed with a **ninja-themed setting** and a simple **mini-story** that helps players immerse themselves in the game world and stay motivated.

Instead of just flipping cards, the player becomes a ninja who is training their memory and focus by uncovering matching symbols.

## Features

* 🧠 Memory-based gameplay (classic pexeso mechanics)
* 🥷 Ninja-themed visuals and atmosphere
* 🎮 Simple and intuitive controls

## How to Play

1. Start the game.
2. Cards are placed face down.
3. Click on two cards to flip them.

6. The game ends when all pairs are found.

* adding a thematic setting,
* creating a small narrative context,
* increasing player engagement through visual style.
